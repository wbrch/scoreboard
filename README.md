# 🏀 Scoreboard Game

This project is my **first solo web development project**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It’s a simple basketball-style scoreboard that allows users to track the score for two teams — **Home** and **Guest** — and includes a built-in **timer** with start, stop, and reset controls.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive scoring system**  
  Add +1, +2, or +3 points for each team dynamically.

- **Real-time timer**  
  Start, stop, and reset a timer displayed in `mm:ss` format.

- **Retro digital design**  
  Styled with a custom LED-style font and a scoreboard-like background.

- **Fully responsive layout**  
  Built using pure CSS Flexbox for a clean, centered layout.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to manipulate the **DOM** using JavaScript (`getElementById`, event handling).  
- How to use **setInterval()** and **clearInterval()** for time-based updates.  
- Basic **CSS styling**, flexbox alignment, and custom fonts with `@font-face`.  
- Structuring and linking multiple front-end files (HTML, CSS, JS).
